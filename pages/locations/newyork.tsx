              Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic beginning in early 2020, New Yorkâ€™s
              mental health crisis was already worsening. New York was heavily
              affected by the pandemic and was not only struggling with the
              economic effects but also the psychological effects on its
              inhabitants. In May of 2020, more than one third of NY adults had
              severe symptoms of psychological disorders. These numbers were
              nearly 3 times worse than numbers from national findings
              pre-pandemic. The pandemic took away the already limited access
              many had to treatment and caused severe distress leading to
              undiagnosed illnesses. As the state of New York recovers, it is
              equally as important for the people to recover. Due to the spike
              in psychological suffering, stigma around mental health has also
              worsened. Combating stigma is what New York needs to
              comprehensively heal. Becoming aware of symptoms, and raising
              awareness is an extremely beneficial way to battle the stigma.
